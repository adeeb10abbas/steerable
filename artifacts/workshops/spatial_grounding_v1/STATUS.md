# SGW-01 status

**Blocked before physical qualification or model inference.**

The supplied study is committed on
`sz5vjy-gme-spatial-grounding-experiments`. Four Terra/Luna child sessions
implemented separate fixture, policy, persistence and analysis components.
Implementation and synthetic tests do not establish scientific readiness.

## Scientific accounting

- Planned: **1,044** episodes (P 36, D 144, C 864).
- Released, valid, censored and partial behavioral episodes: **0** each.
- SGW-01 model requests: **0**.
- Qualified N3/D1 LAT/HEIGHT/DIST branches: **none**.
- Measured prediction coverage, estimates and study figures: **unavailable**.
- Human prediction annotation: **not started**.

No infrastructure attempt is counted as a model failure. No historical episode
was rerun, pooled, replaced or relabeled. The exact supplied package remains
unchanged, including the research-plan manuscript.

## Verified storage and cluster work

Context `prod-dcwi-warrenq1-vmkub007`, namespace `211247-prod`, PVC
`211247-prod-pvc`, mounted at `/data`. New study files reside under
`/data/users/ali/sgw-01/`; historical raw outputs/checkpoints remain untouched.

`sgw01-ali-pvc-lock-20260922` completed on two different nodes. Its two CPU
pods proved durable writes, cross-pod lock exclusion, and lock recovery after
SIGKILL of the probe's own child. It allocated no GPU and ran no model.

`sgw01-ali-rtx-preflight-20260922a` terminated before Isaac import because
the asset check rejected RoboLab's valid `.git` worktree file. That check is
fixed and covered by a regression test. Its assigned GPU also showed
94,729 MiB already occupied.

`sgw01-ali-rtx-preflight-20260922b` could not schedule when that RTX node
was excluded. The scheduler found no other matching worker. This Job is
**suspended**, not running.

`sgw01-ali-rtx-preflight-20260922c` reserved four GPUs temporarily, within
the specification's ceiling, to look for an idle allocated device. All four
reported 94,057-94,729 MiB used and only 2,522-3,194 MiB free. The process
list was empty from the container, so it did not establish ownership of that
memory. The probe failed closed **before any simulator or model import**.
Its Job terminated and released the allocation. No other workload was stopped.

The only observed matching RTX node has eight GPUs and reports sharing
strategy `none`. Allocatable device count did not imply idle memory.

## Artifacts and source identities

Compact evidence is in [`infrastructure/`](infrastructure/). Raw infrastructure
logs and receipts remain in:

```text
/data/users/ali/sgw-01/infrastructure/lock-20260922/
/data/users/ali/sgw-01/preflight/rtx-20260922a/
/data/users/ali/sgw-01/preflight/rtx-20260922c/
```

The source used by the last probe was
`432796d9b04e69febd4bf6adb764d859ef8fe58f`, staged as a clean independent
checkout at `/data/users/ali/sgw-01/source/432796d`. The verified RoboLab
checkout is pinned to `0aef241fb088ca21bb4ebd24448940ed56620d17`. The image
digest and all probe/receipt hashes are recorded in the adjacent JSON state
and evidence. These are infrastructure identities, not a behavioral release.

## Next action

Obtain an authorized, verified idle RTX/Vulkan-capable lane, or have its owner
resolve the occupied framebuffer memory. **Do not kill unidentified processes,
raise the GPU ceiling, rerun a failed Job in place, or release behavioral cells.**

The exact safe cluster-status command is:

```bash
kubectl --context prod-dcwi-warrenq1-vmkub007 --request-timeout=30s \
  -n 211247-prod get jobs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sgw-01
```

After an idle lane is verified, create a new immutable preflight attempt using
the corrected source and recorded runtime settings. A renderer receipt must
precede workspace capture and model-blind fixture qualification. Then qualify
the real Nano/official DreamZero interfaces, raw recorder, resets and time
maps before any direct fixed-input or P/D/C release.
